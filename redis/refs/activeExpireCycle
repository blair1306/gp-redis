<doc f='codebrowser/src/expire.c' l='75'>/* Try to expire a few timed out keys. The algorithm used is adaptive and
 * will use few CPU cycles if there are few expiring keys, otherwise
 * it will get more aggressive to avoid that too much memory is used by
 * keys that can be removed from the keyspace.
 *
 * No more than CRON_DBS_PER_CALL databases are tested at every
 * iteration.
 *
 * This kind of call is used when Redis detects that timelimit_exit is
 * true, so there is more work to do, and we do it more incrementally from
 * the beforeSleep() function of the event loop.
 *
 * Expire cycle type:
 *
 * If type is ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_FAST the function will try to run a
 * &quot;fast&quot; expire cycle that takes no longer than EXPIRE_FAST_CYCLE_DURATION
 * microseconds, and is not repeated again before the same amount of time.
 *
 * If type is ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_SLOW, that normal expire cycle is
 * executed, where the time limit is a percentage of the REDIS_HZ period
 * as specified by the ACTIVE_EXPIRE_CYCLE_SLOW_TIME_PERC define. */</doc>
