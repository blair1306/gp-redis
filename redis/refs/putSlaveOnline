<doc f='codebrowser/src/replication.c' l='843'>/* This function puts a slave in the online state, and should be called just
 * after a slave received the RDB file for the initial synchronization, and
 * we are finally ready to send the incremental stream of commands.
 *
 * It does a few things:
 *
 * 1) Put the slave in ONLINE state (useless when the function is called
 *    because state is already ONLINE but repl_put_online_on_ack is true).
 * 2) Make sure the writable event is re-installed, since calling the SYNC
 *    command disables it, so that we can accumulate output buffer without
 *    sending it to the slave.
 * 3) Update the count of good slaves. */</doc>
