 * really commands, but are used in security attacks in order to talk to
 * Redis instances via HTTP, with a technique called &quot;cross protocol scripting&quot;
 * which exploits the fact that services like Redis will discard invalid
 * HTTP headers and will process what follows.
 *
 * As a protection against this attack, Redis will terminate the connection
 * when a POST or &quot;Host:&quot; header is seen, and will log the event from
 * time to time (to avoid creating a DOS as a result of too many logs). */</doc>
