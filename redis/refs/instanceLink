<doc f='codebrowser/src/sentinel.c' l='122'>/* The link to a sentinelRedisInstance. When we have the same set of Sentinels
 * monitoring many masters, we have different instances representing the
 * same Sentinels, one per master, and we need to share the hiredis connections
 * among them. Oherwise if 5 Sentinels are monitoring 100 masters we create
 * 500 outgoing connections instead of 5.
 *
 * So this structure represents a reference counted link in terms of the two
 * hiredis connections for commands and Pub/Sub, and the fields needed for
 * failure detection, since the ping/pong time are now local to the link: if
 * the link is available, the instance is avaialbe. This way we don&apos;t just
 * have 5 connections instead of 500, we also send 5 pings instead of 500.
 *
 * Links are shared only for Sentinels: master and slave instances have
 * a link with refcount = 1, always. */</doc>
