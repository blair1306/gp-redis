 * command. The returned ID has a few guarantees:
 *
 * 1. The ID is different for each different client, so if the same client
 *    executes a module command multiple times, it can be recognized as
 *    having the same ID, otherwise the ID will be different.
 * 2. The ID increases monotonically. Clients connecting to the server later
 *    are guaranteed to get IDs greater than any past ID previously seen.
 *
 * Valid IDs are from 1 to 2^64-1. If 0 is returned it means there is no way
 * to fetch the ID in the context the function was currently called. */</doc>
