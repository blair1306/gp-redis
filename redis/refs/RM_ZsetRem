 * The function returns REDISMODULE_OK on success, and REDISMODULE_ERR
 * on one of the following conditions:
 *
 * * The key was not opened for writing.
 * * The key is of the wrong type.
 *
 * The return value does NOT indicate the fact the element was really
 * removed (since it existed) or not, just if the function was executed
 * with success.
 *
 * In order to know if the element was removed, the additional argument
 * &apos;deleted&apos; must be passed, that populates the integer by reference
 * setting it to 1 or 0 depending on the outcome of the operation.
 * The &apos;deleted&apos; argument can be NULL if the caller is not interested
 * to know if the element was really removed.
 *
 * Empty keys will be handled correctly by doing nothing. */</doc>
