 * this function consumes the client query buffer and creates a command ready
 * to be executed inside the client structure. Returns C_OK if the command
 * is ready to be executed, or C_ERR if there is still protocol to read to
 * have a well formed command. The function also returns C_ERR when there is
 * a protocol error: in such a case the client structure is setup to reply
 * with the error and close the connection. */</doc>
