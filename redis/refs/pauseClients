 * are paused no command is processed from clients, so the data set can&apos;t
 * change during that time.
 *
 * However while this function pauses normal and Pub/Sub clients, slaves are
 * still served, so this function can be used on server upgrades where it is
 * required that slaves process the latest bytes from the replication stream
 * before being turned to masters.
 *
 * This function is also internally used by Redis Cluster for the manual
 * failover procedure implemented by CLUSTER FAILOVER.
 *
 * The function always succeed, even if there is already a pause in progress.
 * In such a case, the pause is extended if the duration is more than the
 * time left for the previous duration. However if the duration is smaller
 * than the time left for the previous pause, no change is made to the
 * left duration. */</doc>
