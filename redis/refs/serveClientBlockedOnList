<doc f='codebrowser/src/t_list.c' l='719'>/* This is a helper function for handleClientsBlockedOnLists(). It&apos;s work
 * is to serve a specific client (receiver) that is blocked on &apos;key&apos;
 * in the context of the specified &apos;db&apos;, doing the following:
 *
 * 1) Provide the client with the &apos;value&apos; element.
 * 2) If the dstkey is not NULL (we are serving a BRPOPLPUSH) also push the
 *    &apos;value&apos; element on the destination list (the LPUSH side of the command).
 * 3) Propagate the resulting BRPOP, BLPOP and additional LPUSH if any into
 *    the AOF and replication channel.
 *
 * The argument &apos;where&apos; is LIST_TAIL or LIST_HEAD, and indicates if the
 * &apos;value&apos; element was popped fron the head (BLPOP) or tail (BRPOP) so that
 * we can propagate the command properly.
 *
 * The function returns C_OK if we are able to serve the client, otherwise
 * C_ERR is returned to signal the caller that the list POP operation
 * should be undone as the client was not served: This only happens for
 * BRPOPLPUSH that fails to push the value to the destination key as it is
 * of the wrong type. */</doc>
