 * operations on the key.
 *
 * The return value is the handle repesenting the key, that must be
 * closed with RM_CloseKey().
 *
 * If the key does not exist and WRITE mode is requested, the handle
 * is still returned, since it is possible to perform operations on
 * a yet not existing key (that will be created, for example, after
 * a list push operation). If the mode is just READ instead, and the
 * key does not exist, NULL is returned. However it is still safe to
 * call RedisModule_CloseKey() and RedisModule_KeyType() on a NULL
 * value. */</doc>
