<doc f='codebrowser/src/geohash_helper.c' l='85'>/* Return the bounding box of the search area centered at latitude,longitude
 * having a radius of radius_meter. bounds[0] - bounds[2] is the minimum
 * and maxium longitude, while bounds[1] - bounds[3] is the minimum and
 * maximum latitude.
 *
 * This function does not behave correctly with very large radius values, for
 * instance for the coordinates 81.634948934258375 30.561509253718668 and a
 * radius of 7083 kilometers, it reports as bounding boxes:
 *
 * min_lon 7.680495, min_lat -33.119473, max_lon 155.589402, max_lat 94.242491
 *
 * However, for instance, a min_lon of 7.680495 is not correct, because the
 * point -1.27579540014266968 61.33421815228281559 is at less than 7000
 * kilometers away.
 *
 * Since this function is currently only used as an optimization, the
 * optimization is not used for very big radiuses, however the function
 * should be fixed. */</doc>
