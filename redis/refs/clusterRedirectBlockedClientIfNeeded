<doc f='codebrowser/src/cluster.c' l='5407'>/* This function is called by the function processing clients incrementally
 * to detect timeouts, in order to handle the following case:
 *
 * 1) A client blocks with BLPOP or similar blocking operation.
 * 2) The master migrates the hash slot elsewhere or turns into a slave.
 * 3) The client may remain blocked forever (or up to the max timeout time)
 *    waiting for a key change that will never happen.
 *
 * If the client is found to be blocked into an hash slot this node no
 * longer handles, the client is sent a redirection error, and the function
 * returns 1. Otherwise 0 is returned and no operation is performed. */</doc>
