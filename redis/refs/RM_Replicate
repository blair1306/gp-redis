<doc f='codebrowser/src/module.c' l='1177'>/* Replicate the specified command and arguments to slaves and AOF, as effect
 * of execution of the calling command implementation.
 *
 * The replicated commands are always wrapped into the MULTI/EXEC that
 * contains all the commands replicated in a given module command
 * execution. However the commands replicated with RedisModule_Call()
 * are the first items, the ones replicated with RedisModule_Replicate()
 * will all follow before the EXEC.
 *
 * Modules should try to use one interface or the other.
 *
 * This command follows exactly the same interface of RedisModule_Call(),
 * so a set of format specifiers must be passed, followed by arguments
 * matching the provided format specifiers.
 *
 * Please refer to RedisModule_Call() for more information.
 *
 * The command returns REDISMODULE_ERR if the format specifiers are invalid
 * or the command name does not belong to a known command. */</doc>
