 *
 * The function is designed to directly call execve() so that the new
 * server instance will retain the PID of the previous one.
 *
 * The list of flags, that may be bitwise ORed together, alter the
 * behavior of this function:
 *
 * RESTART_SERVER_NONE              No flags.
 * RESTART_SERVER_GRACEFULLY        Do a proper shutdown before restarting.
 * RESTART_SERVER_CONFIG_REWRITE    Rewrite the config file before restarting.
 *
 * On success the function does not return, because the process turns into
 * a different process. On error C_ERR is returned. */</doc>
