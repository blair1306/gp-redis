<doc f='codebrowser/src/cluster.c' l='3009'>/* This function is responsible to decide if this replica should be migrated
 * to a different (orphaned) master. It is called by the clusterCron() function
 * only if:
 *
 * 1) We are a slave node.
 * 2) It was detected that there is at least one orphaned master in
 *    the cluster.
 * 3) We are a slave of one of the masters with the greatest number of
 *    slaves.
 *
 * This checks are performed by the caller since it requires to iterate
 * the nodes anyway, so we spend time into clusterHandleSlaveMigration()
 * if definitely needed.
 *
 * The fuction is called with a pre-computed max_slaves, that is the max
 * number of working (not in FAIL state) slaves for a single master.
 *
 * Additional conditions for migration are examined inside the function.
