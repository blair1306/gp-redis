 * as a side effect setup the slave for a full sync in different ways:
 *
 * 1) Remember, into the slave client structure, the replication offset
 *    we sent here, so that if new slaves will later attach to the same
 *    background RDB saving process (by duplicating this client output
 *    buffer), we can get the right offset from this slave.
 * 2) Set the replication state of the slave to WAIT_BGSAVE_END so that
 *    we start accumulating differences from this point.
 * 3) Force the replication stream to re-emit a SELECT statement so
 *    the new slave incremental differences will start selecting the
 *    right database number.
 *
 * Normally this function should be called immediately after a successful
 * BGSAVE for replication was started, or when there is one already in
 * progress that we attached our slave to. */</doc>
