<doc f='codebrowser/src/module.c' l='2072'>/* Set the field of the specified hash field to the specified value.
 * If the key is an empty key open for writing, it is created with an empty
 * hash value, in order to set the specified field.
 *
 * The function is variadic and the user must specify pairs of field
 * names and values, both as RedisModuleString pointers (unless the
 * CFIELD option is set, see later).
 *
 * Example to set the hash argv[1] to the value argv[2]:
 *
 *      RedisModule_HashSet(key,REDISMODULE_HASH_NONE,argv[1],argv[2],NULL);
 *
 * The function can also be used in order to delete fields (if they exist)
 * by setting them to the specified value of REDISMODULE_HASH_DELETE:
 *
 *      RedisModule_HashSet(key,REDISMODULE_HASH_NONE,argv[1],
 *                          REDISMODULE_HASH_DELETE,NULL);
 *
 * The behavior of the command changes with the specified flags, that can be
 * set to REDISMODULE_HASH_NONE if no special behavior is needed.
 *
 *     REDISMODULE_HASH_NX: The operation is performed only if the field was not
 *                          already existing in the hash.
 *     REDISMODULE_HASH_XX: The operation is performed only if the field was
 *                          already existing, so that a new value could be
 *                          associated to an existing filed, but no new fields
 *                          are created.
 *     REDISMODULE_HASH_CFIELDS: The field names passed are null terminated C
 *                               strings instead of RedisModuleString objects.
 *
 * Unless NX is specified, the command overwrites the old field value with
 * the new one.
 *
 * When using REDISMODULE_HASH_CFIELDS, field names are reported using
 * normal C strings, so for example to delete the field &quot;foo&quot; the following
 * code can be used:
 *
 *      RedisModule_HashSet(key,REDISMODULE_HASH_CFIELDS,&quot;foo&quot;,
 *                          REDISMODULE_HASH_DELETE,NULL);
 *
 * Return value:
 *
 * The number of fields updated (that may be less than the number of fields
 * specified because of the XX or NX options).
 *
 * In the following case the return value is always zero:
 *
 * * The key was not open for writing.
 * * The key was associated with a non Hash value.
