 * the reply callbacks to be called in order to reply to the client.
 * The &apos;privdata&apos; argument will be accessible by the reply callback, so
 * the caller of this function can pass any value that is needed in order to
 * actually reply to the client.
 *
 * A common usage for &apos;privdata&apos; is a thread that computes something that
 * needs to be passed to the client, included but not limited some slow
 * to compute reply or some reply obtained via networking.
 *
 * Note: this function can be called from threads spawned by the module. */</doc>
