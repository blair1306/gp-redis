<doc f='codebrowser/src/replication.c' l='545'>/* Start a BGSAVE for replication goals, which is, selecting the disk or
 * socket target depending on the configuration, and making sure that
 * the script cache is flushed before to start.
 *
 * The mincapa argument is the bitwise AND among all the slaves capabilities
 * of the slaves waiting for this BGSAVE, so represents the slave capabilities
 * all the slaves support. Can be tested via SLAVE_CAPA_* macros.
 *
 * Side effects, other than starting a BGSAVE:
 *
 * 1) Handle the slaves in WAIT_START state, by preparing them for a full
 *    sync if the BGSAVE was succesfully started, or sending them an error
 *    and dropping them from the list of slaves.
 *
 * 2) Flush the Lua scripting script cache if the BGSAVE was actually
 *    started.
 *
 * Returns C_OK on success or C_ERR otherwise. */</doc>
