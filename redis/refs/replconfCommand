 * This command is used by a slave in order to configure the replication
 * process before starting it with the SYNC command.
 *
 * Currently the only use of this command is to communicate to the master
 * what is the listening port of the Slave redis instance, so that the
 * master can accurately list slaves and their listening ports in
 * the INFO output.
 *
 * In the future the same command can be used in order to configure
 * the replication to initiate an incremental replication instead of a
 * full resync. */</doc>
