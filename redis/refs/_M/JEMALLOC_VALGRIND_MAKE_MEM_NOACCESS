 * The size that is reported to Valgrind must be consistent through a chain of
 * malloc..realloc..realloc calls.  Request size isn&apos;t recorded anywhere in
 * jemalloc, so it is critical that all callers of these macros provide usize
 * rather than request size.  As a result, buffer overflow detection is
 * technically weakened for the standard API, though it is generally accepted
 * practice to consider any extra bytes reported by malloc_usable_size() as
 * usable space.
