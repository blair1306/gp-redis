 * Methods for purging unused pages differ between operating systems.
 *
 *   madvise(..., MADV_DONTNEED) : On Linux, this immediately discards pages,
 *                                 such that new pages will be demand-zeroed if
 *                                 the address region is later touched.
 *   madvise(..., MADV_FREE) : On FreeBSD and Darwin, this marks pages as being
 *                             unused, such that they will be discarded rather
 *                             than swapped out.
