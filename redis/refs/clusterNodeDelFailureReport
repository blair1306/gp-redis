 * failing by &apos;sender&apos;. This function is called when a node informs us via
 * gossip that a node is OK from its point of view (no FAIL or PFAIL flags).
 *
 * Note that this function is called relatively often as it gets called even
 * when there are no nodes failing, and is O(N), however when the cluster is
 * fine the failure reports list is empty so the function runs in constant
 * time.
 *
 * The function returns 1 if the failure report was found and removed.
 * Otherwise 0 is returned. */</doc>
