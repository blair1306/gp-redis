 *
 * 1) The old file length is obtained.
 * 2) If the new content is smaller, padding is added.
 * 3) A single write(2) call is used to replace the content of the file.
 * 4) Later the file is truncated to the length of the new content.
 *
 * This way we are sure the file is left in a consistent state even if the
 * process is stopped between any of the four operations.
 *
 * The function returns 0 on success, otherwise -1 is returned and errno
 * set accordingly. */</doc>
