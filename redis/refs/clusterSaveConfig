 * This function writes the node config and returns 0, on error -1
 * is returned.
 *
 * Note: we need to write the file in an atomic way from the point of view
 * of the POSIX filesystem semantics, so that if the server is stopped
 * or crashes during the write, we&apos;ll end with either the old file or the
 * new one. Since we have the full payload to write available we can use
 * a single write to write the whole file. If the pre-existing file was
 * bigger we pad our payload with newlines that are anyway ignored and truncate
 * the file afterward. */</doc>
