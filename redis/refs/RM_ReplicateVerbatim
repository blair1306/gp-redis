 * by the client. Note that this function will not wrap the command into
 * a MULTI/EXEC stanza, so it should not be mixed with other replication
 * commands.
 *
 * Basically this form of replication is useful when you want to propagate
 * the command to the slaves and AOF file exactly as it was called, since
 * the command can just be re-executed to deterministically re-create the
 * new state starting from the old one.
 *
 * The function always returns REDISMODULE_OK. */</doc>
