 * client structure instead of destryoing it. freeClient() will return
 * ASAP after this function returns, so every action needed to avoid problems
 * with a client that is really &quot;suspended&quot; has to be done by this function.
 *
 * The other functions that will deal with the cached master are:
 *
 * replicationDiscardCachedMaster() that will make sure to kill the client
 * as for some reason we don&apos;t want to use it in the future.
 *
 * replicationResurrectCachedMaster() that is used after a successful PSYNC
 * handshake in order to reactivate the cached master.
