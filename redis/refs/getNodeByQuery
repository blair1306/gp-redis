<doc f='codebrowser/src/cluster.c' l='5181'>/* Return the pointer to the cluster node that is able to serve the command.
 * For the function to succeed the command should only target either:
 *
 * 1) A single key (even multiple times like LPOPRPUSH mylist mylist).
 * 2) Multiple keys in the same hash slot, while the slot is stable (no
 *    resharding in progress).
 *
 * On success the function returns the node that is able to serve the request.
 * If the node is not &apos;myself&apos; a redirection must be perfomed. The kind of
 * redirection is specified setting the integer passed by reference
 * &apos;error_code&apos;, which will be set to CLUSTER_REDIR_ASK or
 * CLUSTER_REDIR_MOVED.
 *
 * When the node is &apos;myself&apos; &apos;error_code&apos; is set to CLUSTER_REDIR_NONE.
 *
 * If the command fails NULL is returned, and the reason of the failure is
 * provided via &apos;error_code&apos;, which will be set to:
 *
 * CLUSTER_REDIR_CROSS_SLOT if the request contains multiple keys that
 * don&apos;t belong to the same hash slot.
 *
 * CLUSTER_REDIR_UNSTABLE if the request contains multiple keys
 * belonging to the same slot, but the slot is not stable (in migration or
 * importing state, likely because a resharding is in progress).
 *
 * CLUSTER_REDIR_DOWN_UNBOUND if the request addresses a slot which is
 * not bound to any node. In this case the cluster global state should be
 * already &quot;down&quot; but it is fragile to rely on the update of the global state,
 * so we also handle it here.
 *
 * CLUSTER_REDIR_DOWN_STATE if the cluster is down but the user attempts to
 * execute a command that addresses one or more keys. */</doc>
