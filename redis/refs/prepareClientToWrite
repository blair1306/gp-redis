<doc f='codebrowser/src/networking.c' l='143'>/* This function is called every time we are going to transmit new data
 * to the client. The behavior is the following:
 *
 * If the client should receive new data (normal clients will) the function
 * returns C_OK, and make sure to install the write handler in our event
 * loop so that when the socket is writable new data gets written.
 *
 * If the client should not receive new data, because it is a fake client
 * (used to load AOF in memory), a master or because the setup of the write
 * handler failed, the function returns C_ERR.
 *
 * The function may return C_OK without actually installing the write
 * event handler in the following cases:
 *
 * 1) The event handler should already be installed since the output buffer
 *    already contains something.
 * 2) The client is a slave but not yet online, so we want to just accumulate
 *    writes in the buffer but not actually sending them yet.
 *
 * Typically gets called every time a reply is built, before adding more
 * data to the clients output buffers. If the function returns C_ERR no
 * data should be appended to the output buffers. */</doc>
